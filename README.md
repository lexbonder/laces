# Laces 

[Try it out!](https://lexbonder.github.io/laces/)

## Synopsis

Laces is an online tool for people playing the Tabletop Roleplaying Game, [Roll for Shoes](https://rollforshoes.com/). As the game is played, players take actions and roll six-sided dice to attempt skills and gain new skills. Players gain XP if their attempt fails, and spend XP to gain skills regardless of success or failure of the action.

I first heard about Roll for Shoes on the [Worlds Beyond Number](https://worldsbeyondnumber.com/) Podcast as they played "A County Affair"
